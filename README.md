# 📌 Graph Algorithms

## 📚 Overview
This repository contains implementations of fundamental graph algorithms in Java. These algorithms cover essential graph operations such as searching, shortest path finding, minimum spanning trees, and flow networks. The repository is structured into separate folders, each dedicated to a specific algorithm.

## 🛠️ Implemented Algorithms

### **🔹 BFS Algorithm**
- Implements the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm.
- Used for exploring graphs layer by layer.
- Helpful in finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.

### **🔹 Conex Component**
- Identifies connected components in an undirected graph.
- Determines if a graph is fully connected or consists of multiple disconnected subgraphs.

### **🔹 Dijkstra's Algorithm**
- Finds the shortest path from a single source to all other nodes in a weighted graph.

### **🔹 Find Root in Graph**
- Determines the root node in a graph.
- Useful in tree-based algorithms for defining hierarchical structures.

### **🔹 Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm**
- Computes the maximum flow in a flow network.

### **🔹 Graph Drawing**
- Visualizes graphs using adjacency lists or matrices.

### **🔹 Hard Conex Component**
- Finds strongly connected components in a directed graph.

### **🔹 Kruskal's Algorithm**
- Computes the Minimum Spanning Tree of a graph.
- Uses the Union-Find (Disjoint Set) data structure to ensure efficient merging.

### **🔹 Prim's Algorithm**
- Another algorithm to find the Minimum Spanning Tree.
- Greedy approach to selecting edges with the lowest cost.

### **🔹 Random Graph Drawing**
- Generates random graphs for testing and visualization.

### **🔹 Topological Sort**
- Sorts a Directed Acyclic Graph in linear order.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **Java** for implementation.
